# OliveCMS Theme

Welcome to the OliveCMS Theme repository, a sleek and modern skin for [OrchardCore](https://orchardcore.net/) crafted with care by [PUXdesign](https://www.puxdesign.cz/en/contact). Our mission was to revamp the administration interface of OrchardCore CMS with a look that not only unifies aesthetic elements but also enhances clarity and distinction between different concepts at first glance.

We paid a lot of attention to nested widget sections, so make sure to try that too - just create a widget with a flow inside.

## Features

* **Modernization:** Upgrades the OrchardCore CMS visual layer to meet UI standards.
* **Clarity and Consistency:** Offers a clean and coherent design that retains the full structure of the original admin theme. There is **no change** in admin HTML structure.
* **Bootstrap Foundation:** Technically built upon the solid base of Bootstrap, this theme utilizes bootstrap, while adding new or modifying existing styles to provide desired feel.
